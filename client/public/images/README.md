# Social Media Image Instructions

Place your social media sharing images in this directory using the following naming conventions:

## Required Social Media Images:

1. `/images/stacked-profits-social-card.png` - Main social sharing image (1200x630px)

## Recommended Specifications:

### Facebook/LinkedIn Sharing Image:
- **Filename**: `stacked-profits-social-card.png`
- **Dimensions**: 1200x630 pixels (1.91:1 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Max file size**: Under 1MB

### Twitter Sharing Image:
- Can use the same image as Facebook/LinkedIn
- Twitter will crop it to a 2:1 aspect ratio
- Alternatively, create a separate `twitter-card.png` at 1200x600 pixels

## Design Guidelines:

- Include your logo in the top-left or center of the image
- Use your brand colors (navy blue and green)
- Include a brief text headline (e.g., "Free Websites That Get 3X More Leads")
- Keep important content away from the edges (15% safe margin)
- Ensure text is readable when the image is displayed small

These social images will appear when your website links are shared on:
- Facebook
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- WhatsApp
- Other social platforms and messaging apps
